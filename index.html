    <h2>Project Experience</h2>
    <h3>2D RPG Game</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Employed Unity to develop an RPG-style game addressing nitrogen deposition and climate change utilizing the C# language.</li>
        <li>Engineered the front-end UI components for player interaction, encompassing menu design, volume sliders, and map
            functionality. Orchestrated the back-end infrastructure, encompassing music/sound integration, inventory management, player
            input processing, and object interactions.
            </li>
        <li>Utilized GitHub Desktop to streamline collaboration within the team, facilitating seamless pushing and pulling of each other's
            work to our Git Repository while adeptly preventing the occurrence of merge conflicts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Library Database Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Executed PostgreSQL to construct a comprehensive library database, empowering users to select books from the collection and
            seamlessly facilitate their return process.
            </li>
        <li>Developed a terminal UI using Python to facilitate user interaction within the "library," effectively managing book checkouts by
            updating an Excel sheet.</li>
        <li>Produced SQL source files illustrating the schema and data dump of my project, demonstrating seamless integration with my
            Python code to connect with the created database.
            </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Naive Bayes Classifier for SMS messages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented Python to construct a classification process employing the Naive Bayes Filter algorithm. This involved executing
            data cleaning, conducting model training, and executing classification steps to discern whether a message qualifies as spam or not.</li>
        <li>Devised a data cleansing method encompassing the conversion of text to lowercase, elimination of duplicates, and replacement of
            special characters, numbers, and URLs/email addresses with placeholder tokens.</li>
        <li>Applied Laplace smoothing to ascertain the probability of a word being spam or ham (non-spam) and subsequently utilized the
            Naive Bayes formula to classify new messages as either spam or ham.
            </li>
